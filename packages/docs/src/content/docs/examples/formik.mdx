title: Formik Newsletter
---

In this example we will create a simple newsletter signup form with Formik. It only includes an email field which is validated client-side (note: client-side validation is not safe, thus you might see data other than emails in Netlify).

In order to use Formik's handlers, we use a hook-based approach which allows us to link Formik's submit handler with react-netlify-forms one. Therefore, we have to import `useNetlifyForm` and `useFormik`. Furthermore, we have to use `NetlifyFormProvider` and `NetlifyFormComponent` to render the form with context ourselves:

```js
import {
  useNetlifyForm,
  NetlifyFormProvider,
  NetlifyFormComponent,
  Honeypot
} from 'react-netlify-forms'
import { useFormik } from 'formik'
```

First, we get all Netlify Forms functions through `useNetlifyForm` and then setup Formik with `useFormik`. We supply the former submit handler to Formik's `onSubmit` to link them which means that the form is validated by Formik and then values are sent to the server by react-netlify-forms.

`NetlifyFormProvider` enables us to create the corresponding context by passing Netlify functions through props. In the following, the context is consumed by `NetlifyFormComponent` to render a form with all neccessary attributes.

Instead of managing form state through react-netlify-forms, it is now controlled by Formik with e.g. `handleChange`.

Last but not least, note that we defined validation logic in Formik as a simple check whether input is filled and it matches a regular expression describing emails.

See the full example in action here:

```jsx live
function NewsletterForm() {
  const netlify = useNetlifyForm({
    name: 'Formik',
    action: '/thanks',
    honeypotName: 'bot-field',
    onSuccess: (response, context) => {
      console.log('Successfully sent form data to Netlify Server')
    }
  })
  const {
    handleSubmit,
    handleChange,
    handleBlur,
    touched,
    errors,
    values
  } = useFormik({
    initialValues: { email: '' },
    onSubmit: (values) => netlify.handleSubmit(null, values),
    validate: (values) => {
      const errors = {}
      if (!values.email) {
        errors.email = 'Email is required'
      } else if (
        !/^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}$/i.test(values.email)
      ) {
        errors.email = 'Invalid email address'
      }
      return errors
    }
  })

  return (
    <NetlifyFormProvider {...netlify}>
      <NetlifyFormComponent onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <Honeypot />
        {netlify.success && (
          <p>
            Thanks for contacting us!
          </p>
        )}
        {netlify.error && (
          <p>
            Sorry, we could not reach servers. Because it only works on Netlify,
            our GitHub demo does not provide a response.
          </p>
        )}
        <div>
          <label htmlFor='email'>
            Email:
          </label>
          <input
            type='email'
            name='email'
            id='email'
            onChange={handleChange}
            onBlur={handleBlur}
            value={values.email}
          />
          {touched.email && errors.email ? (
            <div>{errors.email}</div>
          ) : null}
        </div>
        <div>
          <button type='submit'>
            Submit
          </button>
          <button type='reset'>
            Reset
          </button>
        </div>
      </NetlifyFormComponent>
    </NetlifyFormProvider>
  )
}
```
