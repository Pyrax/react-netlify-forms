title: react-hook-form

In this example we will create a simple newsletter signup form with react-hook-form. It only includes an email field which is validated client-side (note: client-side validation is not safe, thus you might see data other than emails in Netlify).

react-hook-form takes a hook-base approach. Therefore, we have to import `useNetlifyForm` and `useForm`. Furthermore, we have to use `NetlifyFormProvider` and `NetlifyFormComponent` to render the form with context ourselves:

```js
import {
  useNetlifyForm,
  NetlifyFormProvider,
  NetlifyFormComponent,
  Honeypot
} from 'react-netlify-forms'
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form'
```

First, we will set react-hook-form up by calling the hook `useForm` with our desired options. Then do the same for react-netlify-forms with `useNetlifyForm`. We link the submit handler from react-hook-form which validates our input with react-netlify-forms with the one from react-netlify-forms which sends the values to the server. Later, we will pass this custom handler to `onSubmit` directly to the form component.

`NetlifyFormProvider` enables us to create the corresponding context by passing Netlify functions through props. In the following, the context is consumed by `NetlifyFormComponent` to render a form with all neccessary attributes including our custom submit method.

Instead of managing form state through react-netlify-forms, it is now controlled by react-hook-form. Validation logic is defined when registering an input. In this example, we only have one email input set as required and check if it matches a regular expression.

See the full example in action here:

```jsx live
function NewsletterForm() {
  const {
    register,
    handleSubmit,
    reset,
    formState: { errors }
  } = useForm({ mode: 'onBlur' })
  const netlify = useNetlifyForm({
    name: 'react-hook-form',
    action: '/thanks',
    honeypotName: 'bot-field',
    onSuccess: (response, context) => {
      console.log('Successfully sent form data to Netlify Server')
    }
  })
  const onSubmit = (data) => netlify.handleSubmit(null, data)

  const EMAIL_REGEX = /^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+.[A-Z]{2,4}$/i

  return (
    <NetlifyFormProvider {...netlify}>
      <NetlifyFormComponent onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
        <Honeypot />
        {netlify.success && (
          <p>
            Thanks for contacting us!
          </p>
        )}
        {netlify.error && (
          <p>
            Sorry, we could not reach servers. Because it only works on Netlify,
            our GitHub demo does not provide a response.
          </p>
        )}
        <div>
          <label htmlFor='email'>
            Email:
          </label>
          <input
            type='email'
            id='email'
            {...register('email', {
              required: 'Email is required',
              pattern: {
                value: EMAIL_REGEX,
                message: 'Invalid email address'
              }
            })}
          />
          {errors.email && (
            <div>{errors.email.message}</div>
          )}
        </div>
        <div>
          <button type='submit'>
            Submit
          </button>
          <button
            type='reset'
            onClick={() => reset()}
          >
            Reset
          </button>
        </div>
      </NetlifyFormComponent>
    </NetlifyFormProvider>
  )
}
```
