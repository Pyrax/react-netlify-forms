First, import required components in your class or function:

```js
import { NetlifyForm, Honeypot, Recaptcha } from 'react-netlify-forms'
```

Also make sure to set the following environment variables for Netlify:

- `SITE_RECAPTCHA_KEY` (used by Netlify)
- `SITE_RECAPTCHA_SECRET` (used by Netlify)

Additionally, you need to make sure to pass `SITE_RECAPTCHA_KEY` as a prop to the reCAPTCHA-component.

_This example is served by Gatsby and uses an additional variable called GATSBY_SITE_RECAPTCHA_KEY for that._

Then, you can use the `NetlifyForm` component in place of the standard form tag. It will provide you form handlers, which manage submitting data to Netlify. Play around and modify this interactive example (`sx` is used for styling):

```jsx live
<NetlifyForm
  name='reCAPTCHA'
  action='/thanks'
  honeypotName='bot-field'
  enableRecaptcha
  onSuccess={(response, context) => {
    console.log('Successfully sent form data to Netlify Server')
    context.formRef.current.reset()
  }}
>
  {({ handleChange, success, error }) => (
    <>
      <Honeypot />
      <Recaptcha siteKey={GATSBY_SITE_RECAPTCHA_KEY} invisible />
      {success && (
        <p>
          Thanks for contacting us!
        </p>
      )}
      {error && (
        <p>
          Sorry, we could not reach servers. Because it only works on Netlify,
          our GitHub demo does not provide a response.
        </p>
      )}
      <div>
        <label htmlFor='name'>
          Name:
        </label>
        <input
          type='text'
          name='name'
          id='name'
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor='message'>
          Message:
        </label>
        <textarea
          type='text'
          name='message'
          id='message'
          rows='4'
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <button type='submit'>
          Submit
        </button>
        <button type='reset'>
          Reset
        </button>
      </div>
    </>
  )}
</NetlifyForm>
```
